# DataPilot - Interactive Machine Learning Platform

Welcome to the **ML Dashboard**! This is a web-based, interactive platform built with **Streamlit** that allows users to explore, visualize, and experiment with machine learning models in real-time. Whether you are a beginner or an expert in machine learning, this tool makes it easy to upload your dataset, select from a variety of models, fine-tune hyperparameters, and evaluate the performance of your model with just a few clicks.

## Features

### **1. Dataset Upload**
- Easily upload your own **CSV files** for analysis
- The app handles missing data with intelligent preprocessing:
  - Numerical data is imputed with **mean** or **median** values
  - Categorical data is imputed using the **most frequent** value.
  
### **2. Model Selection**
- Choose from several popular machine learning algorithms, including:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - (More models may be added in future updates.)

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Adjust hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance. Fine-tune key parameters like:
  - Maximum depth for decision trees
  - Number of estimators in random forests
  - Regularization strength in logistic regression

### **4. Data Preprocessing**
- Automatically handles preprocessing tasks:
  - **Imputes missing values** for both numerical and categorical features.
  - **Standardizes numerical features** using `StandardScaler`.
  - **One-hot encodes** categorical features.

### **5. Model Training & Evaluation**
- Train your selected model and view detailed evaluation metrics:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - **Accuracy**
- Visualize results instantly with easy-to-understand charts.

### **6. Real-time Visualizations**
- Get immediate feedback on model performance with clear, interactive visualizations like:
  - **Confusion matrix plots**
  - **Accuracy score**
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** metrics
  
### **7. User-Friendly Interface**
- Designed for users of all levels, even those without a background in machine learning.
- Intuitive navigation and clear instructions to guide you through the entire process.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Upload Your Dataset**
- Click the "Choose a CSV file" button and select your dataset. A preview of the first few rows will be displayed. Ensure that your dataset includes a **target variable** (the variable you want to predict).

### 2. **Select the Target Column**
- Choose the column that represents the target variable (the label you want to predict).

### 3. **Select a Model**
- From the dropdown menu, select a machine learning model. Available models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

### 4. **Adjust Hyperparameters**
- Some models allow you to adjust hyperparameters, such as:
  - Regularization strength for Logistic Regression
  - Tree depth for Decision Trees
  - Number of estimators for Random Forest
- Use the provided sliders or input fields to adjust these settings

### 5. **Train the Model**
- Click "Train Model" to start the training process. The app will preprocess your data, train the selected model, and provide evaluation metrics and visualizations in real-time.
